# MiniProject
Included: Matlab, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi code

Purpose: Design a control system that regulates the rotational speed of a wheel attached to a motor using an Arduino and Rasberry Pi, along with a mechanical encoder and camera. The input for position will be determined by a marker which depending on the location of it with respect to the camera and the motor will rotate the wheel to the desired position.
